short term:

- Comment everything
	- An actual readme/documentation/man file (maybe)

- prompt environment variable parsing 

- command history

- some clean way to handle opening/closing/reading/writing files
	- readline history file

- command tab completion
	i.e type 'mpla<TAB>' and get 'mplayer'

long term:

- A nice, small and clean configuration file

- 'nameable command registers' for long annoying-to-type commands that can be called like:
	$ reg a
	..invokes long annoying command
	or something like that. Basically alias support like in bash

- Scripting language? Bash(like)? Lua? Lisp? (lol jk)

- Colors!

DONE:
- built-in environment variable subsitution
	i.e echo $user would echo the user name instead of $user
- Better error reporting for non-debug builds
	i.e no 'error in file: function() line 1337'
- Code cleanup, move things to their own files if necessary
