short term:
- readline history

- some clean way to handle opening/closing/reading/writing files
	- readline history file

- built-in environment variable subsitution
	i.e echo $user would echo the user name instead of $user

- command tab completion
	i.e type 'mpla<TAB>' and get 'mplayer'

long term:
- 'nameable command registers' for long annoying-to-type commands that can be called like:
	$ reg a
	..invokes long annoying command
	or something like that. Basically alias support like in bash

- Scripting language? Bash(like)? Lua?

- Colors!
